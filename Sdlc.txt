SDLC = software development life cycle.

SDLC is just a fancy way of saying "the steps or stages that developers follow to build software

Think of it like a recipe for making a dish. You follow different steps, from gathering ingredients to cooking and serving. Similarly, in SDLC, developers follow a series of steps to create software, making sure it works well and meets the needs of the users.
